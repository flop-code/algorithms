# Algorithms
My implementation of interesting (in my opinion) algorithms in different programming languages.

# Additional info
### I use g++ (C++17 standart) to compile C/C++ files, and Python 3.7 to run Python files.
### All solutions are written in olympic style, so they may contain some evil things like "special variables naming", and so on.
### By default, if you run the file with name "main", it will automaticly start the tests for the solution.
