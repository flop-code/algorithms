# Algorithms
My implementation of interesting (in my opinion) algorithms in different programming languages.

# Additional info
### I use latest gcc to compile C/C++ files, and Python 3.7 to run Python files.
### All solutions are written in olympic style, so they may contain some evil things like global variables, and so on.
